/*
IF ELSE statement with numbers

Complete a function that takes in two parameters, both numbers representing totals for 
dogs and cats, determines if dogs are more than 8 and cats are fewer than 9, and returns 
a specific string for each case. Your function should use an if else statement to 
determine if there are both more than 8 dogs and fewer than 9 cats, and if there are, 
should return the string 'number of cats and dogs is acceptable', and if not, should 
return the string 'number of cats or dogs is not acceptable'.

    // if there are more than 8 dogs and fewer than 9 cats
      // return 'number of cats and dogs is acceptable'
    // otherwise
      // return 'number of cats or dogs is not acceptable'
      
    if (dogs > 8 && cats < 9) return 'number of cats and dogs is acceptable';
    else return 'number of cats or dogs is not acceptable';
