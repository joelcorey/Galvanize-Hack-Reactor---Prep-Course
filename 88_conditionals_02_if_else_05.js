/*
IF ELSE statement with an object

Complete a function that takes in one parameter, an object containing the fruit totals 
for a project, and determines whether the listed total for bananas is greater than 3 
and the listed total for strawberries is greater than 10, and returns a specific string 
for each case. Your function should use an if else statement to determine if the totals 
of bananas and strawberries are sufficient, and if they are, should return the 
string 'We have enough fruit, with ' + {totalBananas} + ' bananas, and ' 
+ {totalStrawberries} + ' strawberries', where {totalBananas} and {totalStrawberries} 
are the numbers of each fruit in the fruit totals object. If they are not, your 
function should return the string 'We do not have enough of both fruits'.
