/*
assertArraysEqual

Write a function called assertArraysEqual. It will be a function that takes three 
parameters: actual will be an array of scalar values, and should ideally be the result 
of calling a function that you are testing. (presumably the function being tested 
should return an array of scalar values); expected, also an array of scalar values, 
should be the theoretical result of calling your function (or, what you "expect" the 
function to return). Finally, testName will be a string, and should describe what a 
call to assertArraysEqual is verifying about the function being tested.

Please DO NOT USE JSON.stringify(), Array.join(), or any other "convert both arrays 
to strings so I can compare two strings" type of technique to implement this.

We cannot simply compare an array directly to another array, as we could with scalar 
values. Consider the following code:

var scalar1 = 'equal';
var scalar2 = 'equal';
console.log("two scalars can be compared with each other using triple equals: ", scalar1 === scalar2);

var array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
var array2 = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
console.log("two arrays can be compared with each other using triple equals: ", array1 === array2);

As this code demonstrates, we cannot compare arrays directly. For more information on 
this topic, please consult the lesson named Notes on Memory, which can be found in the 
Reference Answers and In Depth Documentation section at end of this Module. With that 
in mind, there are typically two things that we must check in order to determine that 
two arrays of scalar values are indeed equal to one another. Do they have the same 
length, and do they contain the same values. Thus, your function must make a 
determination about these issues, then either log a passing message to the console 
or else a failure message. See the examples below for precise details on the messages 
to be logged to the console.

Mentioned previously, but worth noting again: In general, these assertion functions 
will need some kind of code or separate functions to test. For the first four Testing 
problems, we will provide examples that include functions like generateFirstNFibonaccis. 
It is not necessary for you to create these functions. Rather, they are presented to 
aid your understanding of how assertArraysEqual should behave once you have built it.

Please pay close attention to the exact punctuation and contents of the success and 
failure messages.

Examples:

SUCCESS CASE

var expected = ['b', 'r', 'o', 'k', 'e', 'n'];
var actual = 'broken'.split('');
assertArraysEqual(actual, expected, 'splits string into array of characters');
// console output:
// passed

FAILURE CASE

var expected = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13];
var actual = generateFirstNFibonaccis(7);
assertArraysEqual(actual, expected, 'generates first 7 Fibonacci numbers');
// console output:
// FAILED [generates first 7 Fibonacci numbers] Expected "1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 
*/

function generateFirstNFibonaccis(n) {
    return n < 1 ? 0
        : n <= 2 ? 1
        : generateFirstNFibonaccis(n - 1) + generateFirstNFibonaccis(n - 2);
}

function assertArraysEqual(actual, expected, testName) {
    if (actual.length !== expected.length) {
        console.log(`FAILED [${testName}] Expected "${expected}", but got "${actual}"`);
        return;
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < actual.length; i++) {
        if (actual[i] !== expected[i]) {
            console.log(`FAILED [${testName}] Expected "${expected}", but got "${actual}"`);
            return;
        }
    }
    console.log('passed');
    return;
}

// var expected = ['b', 'r', 'o', 'k', 'e', 'n'];
// var actual = 'broken'.split('');
// assertArraysEqual(actual, expected, 'splits string into array of characters');
// // console output:
// // passed

var expected = [-5, 0, 5];
var actual = [-5, 0, 5];
assertArraysEqual(actual, expected, 'my test');
// console output:
// passed

// var expected = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13];
// var actual = generateFirstNFibonaccis(7);
// assertArraysEqual(actual, expected, 'generates first 7 Fibonacci numbers');
// // console output:
// // FAILED [generates first 7 Fibonacci numbers] Expected "1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13", but got "2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34"
