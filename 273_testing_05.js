Applying assertEqual 2

Write an "assertEqual" function once more, from memory. Please DO NOT simply PASTE in 
from before (If you have to go back and look at your previously-implemented code once, 
that is certainly okay, but come back here and write it from memory). Then use 
your assertion function in a series of test cases to thoroughly test the code. 
Use categorical reasoning to consider all the useful cases. The only automated 
test will be one to ensure that you have created a function that is named assertEqual. 
It is up to you to construct the rest of the "test suite".

The code under test is a function called every. every is an example of a 
"higher order" function, meaning that it takes as a parameter, another function 
(higher order functions can also return functions as values). This function takes 
two parameters; the first will be an array of scalar values, and the second parameter 
will be callbackFunction. Thus, when you are creating a test suite to verify that 
every works, you are going to need a function that you will use as an argument when 
you call every. Think about it like this, every is going to iterate over an array of 
scalar values, and apply a function to every value. This function MUST return a 
boolean value, mainly because we want every to tell us whether or not, EVERY value 
in the array returns true when the callbackFunction is called upon it.

At this point, the general level of difficulty and complexity of the problems 
will increase. With that in mind, do not be disheartened if this takes you some 
time to figure out solutions. The first step will be to set up some tests for the 
code, then correct the errors in the implementation. If you are truly stumped, please 
feel free to consult the reference answers in the last section of the module. Ideally, 
you should eventually complete the problem on your own.
